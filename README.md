Task: Social Media for Uni Tuebingen 

## Features
Our current state of the app can create and log in users. After the sign-in or sign-up, we come to our feed, where the appropriate user profile picture and username can be seen. We can also create tweets. There you also see the Like and comment counts of the tweets and you are able to comment and like tweets.
We have a route and a view for the Profile-Setting and its connected with the database. You can change your personal Informations and set a profile picture and bio there.

For the admin we have a temporary button on the SignIn page to get to the Admin SignIn. There you can already sign in, or sign up. We still have to change the way an admin user is created. The sign up form is also temporay. 
It is possilbe to delete tweets on the admin feed page.
